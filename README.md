<H2>Getting started</H2>

0. Read prerequisites

1. Download the latest release from the repository.


2. Open "configfile.py" (with notepad for instance) and add your ethereum/bsc address and personal key at the bottom of the file between the quotation marks(''). You can also define how many threads you want running at once (=how many instances of the bot at once). The latter option can not be changed within the GUI. Please note, that the bot will buy multiple times when more than 1 thread are used.

<pre>...
threads='1'
my_address = ''
my_pk = ''</pre>


3. Run "Sniping bot 21-5 Final-1152-utc.exe"

- Make sure configfile.py and bot.exe are in the same folder.
- If error occurs, you can run the bot by starting "patcher_v3.exe" and closing the command line after the bot launches

4. Edit settings according to choice.
